            During the Second World War, British military statisticians managed
            to estimate the number of German Panzer tanks in circulation
            according to the simple formula (M-1)(S+1)/S. Simply by having
            a series of serial numbers and taking the maximum M and 
            the sample size S they produced an accurate estimate (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jul/20/secondworldwar.tvandradio">read more about this</a>).

            Now in 2010 we want to try the same thing, but this time
            to establish the <b>true</b> number of high-throughput sequencers 
            shipped to laboratories world-wide. We will hopefully be able
            to use the same principle, assuming the serial numbers are
            sequential. In conjunction with the data from the
            <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/">high-throughput sequencing map</a>
            this should provide the most detailed snapshot of the sequencing
            market so far.

            If you want to take part (anonymously), simply enter your 
            serial number and approximate installation date, as well
            as your geographic location (state and country will do).
            We'll check the submissions and post the results here.

                KMCarr suggested to look at serial numbers and
